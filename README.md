4. Detailed discussion of previous work related to this problem (Literature review) 
5. Project Design 
  - Describe key design goals in designing your distributed systems i.e how your design allows the system to handle the core distributed systems challenges: Heterogeneity, Openness, Security, Failure Handling, Concurrency, Quality of Service, Scalability, and Transparency. 
 - Describe the key components and algorithms 
 - Describe your architecture and how the components will interact. You must include several UML diagrams to illustrate your design (at least 3 diagrams from below list to illustrate proper overview of the system. 
   i. Use Case style diagram to show the overview of your system functionality and different functions in your system.  
   ii. Use the Deployment and Component diagrams to show the software and hardware components of your system.  
   iii. Communication diagram to illustrate the connections between the components,  
   iv. Sequence diagram explains the sequence of actions, events, and processes between the components, objects, and actors in your system.  
   v. Activity and State diagrams to explain more detail about a process or object in your system.
